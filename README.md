#TextBattle: a very bad game made by Jack S, aka TheRandomRock03  
  
TextBattle is a very simple turn-based two-player fighting game played through the terminal  
Keep in mind that I am young, unexperienced, and I write very bad code. **Very Bad**  
This repo is mostly so that I can work on my project across multiple computers and share it with my friends.  
If you would like to help with the project, please use the syntax that I do -- that is, very bad syntax. Plz comment. I am only merging pull requests if it a) does not change much, if any, of the existing code, and b) follows the above rules.  
The batch files are windows only to help me because I dislike IDE's (stupid, I know, but I am more comfortable with vim).   
Sorry I do not have any bash files to compile and run. If you would like to add some, you are more than welcome :)  
  
###Commands for the game:  
*check: displays stats for both players  
+attack: subtracts the other player's health by the base damage and a random number between 0 and 10.  
-quit: calls System.exit(0)  
    
###TODO:  
Change stats, namely health  
Add more methods  
Create subclasses, e.g. Mage, Knight, Archer, although this will require some heavy refactoring  
  
  
Note that I swear a lot.
